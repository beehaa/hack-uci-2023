                            <p>Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical. Housing costs, utilities, and basic sustenance are harder to eliminate than "entertainment," eating out, or clothing expenses.</p>

                            <p>Free online tools (like Mint.com and Personal Capital) or spreadsheets like those found in the Wiki's Tools page can help you track your expenses.</p>

                            <p>Once your budget is figured out, you need to figure out what your goals are. Secure retirement? Buy a house? Save for a car? We'll get to specifics on how to save for these a little later on.</p>

                            <p>An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up. Unexpected travel, essential appliance replacement, and sudden medical procedures are all user-submitted examples of emergency funds in action. If you need to draw from your emergency fund at any time, your first priority as soon as you get back on your feet should be to replenish it. Treat your emergency fund right and it will return the favor.</p>

                            <p><b>How should I size my emergency fund?</b> For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund (e.g., 9 to 12 months) may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain.</p>

                            <p>tldr; (Either $1,000 or one months' worth of expenses, whichever is greater; use a savings or checking account.)</p>

                            <p>The next step is to contribute to an IRA for the current tax year. You can also contribute for the previous tax year if it's between January 1st and April 15th. See the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/iras/">IRA wiki</a> for more information on IRAs. Try to save up to 15% of your gross income until reaching the annual limit of $6,500 (in 2023).</p>

Talk to some people in the military or veterans other than your recruiter before you commit.  Also note that dropping out of ROTC can be very expensive so you should probably not enter ROTC if you have any potential medical or mental health issues.</p></li>

                            If you're at all on the fence about going to college, or your chosen major, it makes sense to find someone who's gone through your prospective degree program, take them to lunch, and get their feedback on how their path has treated them.</p>

                                    Consider fallback options as well. If your career plan requires certain things that may not come to pass (such as being accepted into a top ten law school), and your plans are forced to change, what are your options? An undergraduate degree in business or engineering at that point may bear more fruit than a bachelor's in philosophy.</p>

                                <p>A lot of noise has been made lately about STEM careers. However, remember that your working career is going to span multiple decades; that's a very long time to spend doing something you aren't passionate about—or at least enjoy. Virtually nobody wakes up eager to go to work just because of their paycheck so it's important to pick something that excites you, because without passion, you're most likely destined to never be particularly good at your field of study.</p>

                                <li><p>If you want to save money, live with your parents as long as you can.  Seriously!   But there comes a time when you want to / have to leave, and you'll need to rent a place.  Landlords will want to see that <a href="http://www.myfirstapartment.com/2015/06/how-much-rent-can-i-afford-on-my-income-two-simple-ways-to-estimate/" rel="nofollow">you have income</a>, so try to keep payments below <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/how-much-rent-you-can-really-afford-renters-solutions-186462" rel="nofollow">30% of your takehome pay</a>.  You may need a co-signer if you have minimal credit history.   You'll need first month's rent and a security deposit up front, and even utility deposits sometimes.  Read your lease before you sign it, and know your <a href="https://www.ziprealty.com/buy/renters-rights.jsp" rel="nofollow">rights and responsibilities</a> as a tenant, and what organizations can help you if you encounter issues.  </p></li>
                                <li><p>Roommates are a popular way to save money on rent.  Be aware of the issues that can come up with roommates though, since circumstances change, and you may be on the hook for their share.  Have all roommates on the lease.  You might even want a <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/free-books/renters-rights-book/chapter6-2.html" rel="nofollow">roommate agreement</a>.  Perhaps Sheldon Cooper has it right after all?  Alternatively, consider renting a room from someone who owns their own house.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Aside from rent, cars are the biggest expenditure for many young people.  You can save a <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/total-cost-owning-car/" rel="nofollow">lot of money</a> if you don't need to pay for one!   It's not just the purchase cost.  There's gas, repairs, and especially <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/carinsurance" rel="nofollow">car insurance</a>, which is  <a href="http://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/cheapest-minimum-liability-insurance.aspx" rel="nofollow">very expensive</a> for young people, typically at least $100/month, and can even be $200/month in some places, or if you have a tickets / accidents. </p></li>
                                <li><p>Your best bet if you do need a car is to save up enough cash to buy a <a href="http://www.carsdirect.com/used-car-buying/best-5-reliable-used-car-models" rel="nofollow">reliable used car</a> without needing a loan so you can avoid finance charges and make your own insurance choices.  Above all else, make sure you follow the <a href="/r/personalfinance/wiki/vehicles" rel="nofollow">budgeting advice in the vehicles wiki</a>.  And if you do need to finance a car, be very careful of financing offers for young people.  Double-digit interest rates are a Bad Thing.  You do not want to "build credit" that way! The loan and the car are different things.  You can't give back the car and be done with the loan, since you will typically be "<a href="http://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/being-upside-down.html" rel="nofollow">underwater</a>" and owe more than the car is worth.  </p></li>
                                <li><p>Choose your spending wisely.  Money spent is unavailable for anything else. Make sure it was your highest priority use of that money.</p></li>

            <h2>Monthly 50/30/20 Budget Calculator</h2>
            <p>Whether you use an app or a budget worksheet to get a handle on your spending, you'll want to know where your money is going — and then make a plan for where you want it to go.
            </p>
            <p>The 50/30/20 budget is a good tool to do just that.</p>
            <p>Use the calculator to estimate how you might divide your monthly income into needs, wants and savings. This will give you a big-picture view of your finances. The most important number is the smallest: the 20% dedicated to savings. Once you achieve that, perhaps with an employer-sponsored retirement plan and other automated monthly savings transfers, the rest — that big 80% chunk — is up for debate.</p>
            <p>That leaves 50% for needs and 30% for wants, but these are parameters you can tweak to suit your reality. For example, if you live in an expensive housing market, your monthly mortgage or rent payment might spill a bit into your "wants" budget. Budgets are meant to bend but not be broken.</p>

                Entertainment expenses are certainly discretionary, however, if you are dedicated to achieving financial health and getting rid of debt, it is best to keep discretionary spending at an absolute minimum until your high interest debt is paid off. Informed decision making (paired with common sense) can be a great tool to employ while forming a healthy financial strategy; use it!</p>
            <p><i class="info circle icon"></i> <b> Disclaimer: </b>This chart is a supplemental guide, there are circumstances where you may need to alter your approach (such as earning income that exceeds the Roth IRA limit, thus creating need to pursue Backdoor Roth contributions). To make optimal financial decisions for your unique situation (Snowball vs. Avalanche, Roth vs. Traditional, etc.), it is vital to spend the time cultivating the necessary knowledge to enable you to move forward from an informed place of strength.</p>
